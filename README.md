## Bootstrap Jade Stylus Gulp Boilerplate

A minimal seed comprising of Bootstrap, Jade, Stylus, Gulp and some basic imports, like Google Webfonts, FontAwesome, etc.

## Installation

You can simply fork and clone (or download) the repo into your local directory:

```
  $ git clone https://github.com/FarhadG/bootstrap-jade-stylus-gulp-boilerplate.git
  $ cd bootstrap-jade-stylus-gulp-boilerplate
  $ npm install
  $ gulp
```

## Usage

The default gulp command builds all the files from `src` to `dist` folder and then watches for changes. You can then fire up a server (to retrieve some of the CDN files) and/or open `index.html` under the `dist` folder.

To simply build without watching, you can `$ gulp build`.

## Options

I'll be adding more features; that said, if you'd like a feature, let me know so that I'll try and implement it into future updates.
